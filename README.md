# Random Quote Generator

This is a simple "Quote Generator" app that gives you inspiration and motivation. It now has 100 different quotes, all stored in a JSON file. The app uses JavaScript to load these quotes and display them randomly when you click a button. Every time you use the generator, the background color and the button color also change randomly, making it a fun and colorful experience. Whether you need wisdom or encouragement, just click the button to get a new quote and a fresh look.
